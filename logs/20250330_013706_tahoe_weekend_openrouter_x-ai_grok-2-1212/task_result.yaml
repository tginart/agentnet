result: I've checked the weather in Tahoe for this weekend, and while there's expected
  snow, there are no blizzard warnings. However, I couldn't find any 5-star Airbnb
  listings available for this weekend. The closest I found is a 4.9-star Rustic A-Frame
  Cabin. Would you like to consider this option, or should I continue searching for
  a 5-star listing?
task: Find me a 5-star getaway to Tahoe this weekend, make sure there is no blizzard
