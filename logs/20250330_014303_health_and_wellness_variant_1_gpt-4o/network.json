Include basic strength training exercises twice a week.\n   - **Month 2:** Increase cardio to 30-40 minutes, 4 times a week, and add interval training once a week.\n   - **Month 3:** Continue with 40-minute cardio sessions, 4 times a week, and include flexibility exercises like yoga or Pilates once a week.\n   - **Month 4:** Increase cardio to 45 minutes, 4-5 times a week, and incorporate a variety of activities like swimming or running.\n   - **Month 5:** Focus on endurance by participating in a local 5K event or similar challenge. Maintain strength training and flexibility exercises.\n   - **Month 6:** Aim for 50-minute cardio sessions, 5 times a week, with a mix of steady-state and interval training. Evaluate progress and adjust the plan as needed.\n\n2. **Nutritional Plan:**\n   - Assume a balanced diet with an estimated daily caloric intake suitable for moderate exercise. Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.\n   - Adjust caloric intake based on specific fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain).\n\n3. **Medication Check:**\n   - Without specific medication details, assume common medications like antihypertensives or statins. Ensure any planned exercises or dietary changes are generally safe, but consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n\n### Motivation and Resources\n\n- Track progress using a fitness app or journal.\n- Join a local fitness group or find a workout buddy for accountability.\n- Celebrate small milestones to maintain enthusiasm.\n- Access online workout videos for variety and guidance.\n- Consider consulting with a fitness trainer for personalized advice if needed.\n\nThis plan is designed to gradually increase your endurance and overall fitness, helping you achieve your cardiovascular health goals. If you have any specific preferences or restrictions, feel free to let me know!"
