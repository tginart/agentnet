Let me summarize the information and provide you with the best advice based on the available data:\n\n1. Accommodation:\nUnfortunately, the Airbnb agent doesn't have a specific tool to search for 5-star accommodations or check availability for this weekend in Tahoe. However, they can provide general information about Airbnb listings in the Tahoe area. This won't specifically filter for 5-star accommodations or check weekend availability, but it can give you an overview of what's available.\n\n2. Weather Conditions:\nThe Weather agent encountered some issues retrieving weather alerts for both California and Nevada (Tahoe is located on the border of these two states). This could mean either:\n   a) There are currently no active weather alerts for the Tahoe area.\n   b) There might be a temporary problem with the weather alert system.\n\nGiven this information, here's what I recommend:\n\n1. For accommodations:\n   - We can proceed with getting general Airbnb listings for Tahoe to give you an idea of what's available.\n   - You may want to consider using other booking platforms or directly contacting high-end resorts in the Tahoe area for 5-star options.\n\n2. For weather conditions:\n   - While we couldn't confirm or deny a blizzard warning, the lack of alerts might be a good sign.\n   - It would be wise to keep monitoring the weather situation closely, as mountain weather can change rapidly.\n   - Check other official weather sources, such as the National Weather Service website, for the most up-to-date information.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with getting the general Airbnb listings for Tahoe? Also, is there any other information you'd like me to try to find regarding your planned getaway?"

However, they can provide general information about Airbnb listings in the Tahoe area. This won't specifically filter for 5-star accommodations or check weekend availability, but it can give you an overview of what's available.\n\n2. Weather Conditions:\nThe Weather agent encountered some issues retrieving weather alerts for both California and Nevada (Tahoe is located on the border of these two states). This could mean either:\n   a) There are currently no active weather alerts for the Tahoe area.\n   b) There might be a temporary problem with the weather alert system.\n\nGiven this information, here's what I recommend:\n\n1. For accommodations:\n   - We can proceed with getting general Airbnb listings for Tahoe to give you an idea of what's available.\n   - You may want to consider using other booking platforms or directly contacting high-end resorts in the Tahoe area for 5-star options.\n\n2. For weather conditions:\n   - While we couldn't confirm or deny a blizzard warning, the lack of alerts might be a good sign.\n   - It would be wise to keep monitoring the weather situation closely, as mountain weather can change rapidly.\n   - Check other official weather sources, such as the National Weather Service website, for the most up-to-date information.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with getting the general Airbnb listings for Tahoe?
