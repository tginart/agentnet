Everything sounds good so far. \n\nFor the studio spaces, I guess we can go with the same three locations as the universities: Berlin, Tokyo, and S\u00e3o Paulo. As for the duration, let's say a couple of months should be fine. I don't have specific size requirements, just something that can accommodate a few artists and their tech. Budget-wise, I\u2019m not too picky, so let\u2019s keep it reasonable. Preferred dates? Maybe starting in January and wrapping up by March?\n\nFor the public exhibitions, I think we should stick with the same cities: Berlin, Tokyo, and S\u00e3o Paulo. Dates? How about we aim for the end of March? That should give us enough time after the residency.\n\nIf that works for you, just go ahead and make it happen! Thanks! \n\nTASK COMPLETE"

Everything sounds good so far. \n\nFor the studio spaces, I guess we can go with the same three locations as the universities: Berlin, Tokyo, and S\u00e3o Paulo. As for the duration, let's say a couple of months should be fine. I don't have specific size requirements, just something that can accommodate a few artists and their tech. Budget-wise, I\u2019m not too picky, so let\u2019s keep it reasonable. Preferred dates? Maybe starting in January and wrapping up by March?\n\nFor the public exhibitions, I think we should stick with the same cities: Berlin, Tokyo, and S\u00e3o Paulo. Dates? How about we aim for the end of March? That should give us enough time after the residency.\n\nIf that works for you, just go ahead and make it happen! Thanks! \n\nTASK COMPLETE"

Everything sounds good so far. \n\nFor the studio spaces, I guess we can go with the same three locations as the universities: Berlin, Tokyo, and S\u00e3o Paulo. As for the duration, let's say a couple of months should be fine. I don't have specific size requirements, just something that can accommodate a few artists and their tech. Budget-wise, I\u2019m not too picky, so let\u2019s keep it reasonable. Preferred dates? Maybe starting in January and wrapping up by March?\n\nFor the public exhibitions, I think we should stick with the same cities: Berlin, Tokyo, and S\u00e3o Paulo. Dates? How about we aim for the end of March? That should give us enough time after the residency.\n\nIf that works for you, just go ahead and make it happen! Thanks! \n\nTASK COMPLETE"

Everything sounds good so far. \n\nFor the studio spaces, I guess we can go with the same three locations as the universities: Berlin, Tokyo, and S\u00e3o Paulo. As for the duration, let's say a couple of months should be fine. I don't have specific size requirements, just something that can accommodate a few artists and their tech. Budget-wise, I\u2019m not too picky, so let\u2019s keep it reasonable. Preferred dates? Maybe starting in January and wrapping up by March?\n\nFor the public exhibitions, I think we should stick with the same cities: Berlin, Tokyo, and S\u00e3o Paulo. Dates? How about we aim for the end of March? That should give us enough time after the residency.\n\nIf that works for you, just go ahead and make it happen! Thanks! \n\nTASK COMPLETE"
