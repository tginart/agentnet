Let me summarize what has been filled out and what crucial information is still missing.\n\nSummary of Completed Information on NY IT-203 Form:\n1. Income earned in New York: $25,000\n2. Federal Adjusted Gross Income: $85,000\n3. New York Adjusted Gross Income: $25,000\n4. Allocated deductions: $3,000\n\nCrucial Information Missing:\n1. Exact dates of residency and non-residency periods in New York.\n2. Details of any New York-specific tax credits or adjustments that may be applicable.\n3. Confirmation of any additional income sources specific to New York not yet reported.\n\nTo complete the New York IT-203 form accurately, we need to provide the following information:\n\n1. Residency Dates: We need to specify the exact dates you were in New York for work. This helps determine your tax liability and ensures accurate reporting.\n\n2. New York Tax Credits/Adjustments: If you're eligible for any New York-specific tax credits or adjustments, we should identify and include them. This could potentially reduce your tax liability.\n\n3. Additional New York Income: We need to confirm if there are any other sources of income you received while in New York that haven't been accounted for yet.\n\nCan you provide any of this missing information? Specifically:\n\n1. Do you know the exact dates you worked in New York during the tax year?\n2. Are you aware of any New York-specific tax credits or adjustments you might be eligible for?\n3. Can you confirm if the $25,000 reported as New York income includes all sources of income you received while working in the state?\n\nOnce we have this information, we can instruct the TurboTax agent to complete the form accurately."

Missing state-specific tax form:\n   - New York IT-203: Nonresident and Part-Year Resident Income Tax Return\n\nBased on this information, it appears that most of the required state-specific tax forms have been included in the TurboTax filing. However, there is one important form that is currently missing and needs to be addressed.\n\nAction Required:\nThe TurboTax agent has identified that the New York IT-203 form (Nonresident and Part-Year Resident Income Tax Return) needs to be completed and included in the tax filing. This form is necessary because you earned income in New York while being a resident of California.\n\nTo resolve this issue and ensure your tax filing is complete, we should take the following steps:\n\n1. Complete the New York IT-203 form: This form is used to report income earned in New York by non-residents or part-year residents.\n\n2. Gather necessary information: We'll need details about the income earned specifically in New York, including the amount and type of income.\n\n3. Include the form in the TurboTax filing: Once completed, we'll need to add this form to your current tax filing.\n\nWould you like me to instruct the TurboTax agent to initiate the process of completing the New York IT-203 form? Or do you have any questions about this missing form or the state-specific tax requirements?"

I'll try to make this as painless as possible for you. Could you please provide answers to these three questions:\n\n1. What were the approximate dates you worked in New York during the tax year? (Even a rough estimate like \"about 3 months in the summer\" would be helpful)\n2. Are you aware of any special tax credits or adjustments you might be eligible for in New York? (If you're not sure, that's okay)\n3. Does the $25,000 reported as New York income sound correct to you? Is there any other income you received while in New York that might not be included in this amount?\n\nOnce we have this information, I can finalize your tax filing without any further input from you."
