  \ is now complete, and I have good news about your refund. Here's a quick summary:\n\
  \n1. You'll receive a total refund of $2,600. This includes:\n   - Federal tax refund:\
  \ $2,300\n   - California state tax refund: $500\n   - New York state taxes owed:\
  \ $200 (which will be deducted from your total refund)\n\n2. All necessary forms\
  \ have been completed, including the New York IT-203 form with the information you\
  \ provided.\n\n3. The returns are now ready for submission to the IRS and state\
  \ tax authorities.\n\nSince you mentioned wanting to be done with taxes and not\
  \ wanting to think about them anymore, I recommend we proceed with submitting the\
  \ returns. This will complete the process without requiring any further action from\
  \ you.\n\nUnless you tell me otherwise, I'll instruct the TurboTax agent to submit\
  \ your federal, California, and New York tax returns to the respective authorities.\
  \ After submission, you can expect to receive your refund in the coming weeks, typically\
  \ via direct deposit if you've set that up, or by check if not.\n\nIs there anything\
  \ else you need to know before I proceed with the submission? If not, I'll go ahead\
  \ and submit the returns for you, and you can consider your taxes done for the year."
