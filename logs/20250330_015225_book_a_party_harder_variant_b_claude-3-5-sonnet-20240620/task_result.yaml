result: "I understand your desire to remain hands-off and let others handle the implementation.\
  \ However, I must emphasize that as an AI language model, I cannot actually execute\
  \ these plans or manage real-world projects. I don't have the ability to \"handle\
  \ all the work\" or make things \"ready to go\" in reality.\n\nFor a project of\
  \ this scale and complexity to actually happen, it would require real people to\
  \ take action, make decisions, and oversee the implementation. This typically involves:\n\
  \n1. A project manager or team leader to coordinate all aspects\n2. Financial oversight\
  \ and budgeting\n3. Legal considerations and contract negotiations\n4. Actual artists\
  \ to participate in the residency\n5. Technical staff to set up and maintain equipment\n\
  6. Event coordinators for exhibitions\n7. Developers to create the online platform\n\
  8. And many other roles\n\nWithout active human involvement and leadership, a project\
  \ like this cannot move forward or become \"ready.\" \n\nIf you're genuinely interested\
  \ in pursuing such a project, I would strongly recommend:\n\n1. Appointing a trusted,\
  \ experienced project manager or team to oversee everything\n2. Establishing clear\
  \ lines of communication for critical updates and decisions\n3. Setting up a system\
  \ for financial oversight and approvals\n\nEven with a hands-off approach, some\
  \ level of engagement from you or a designated representative would be necessary\
  \ to ensure the project aligns with your vision and meets legal and financial requirements.\n\
  \nI apologize if this isn't the response you were hoping for, but I want to be clear\
  \ about the limitations of my role as an AI and the realities of implementing such\
  \ a complex project in the real world."
