Cholesterol Levels\n- Total cholesterol\n- LDL (bad) cholesterol\n- HDL (good) cholesterol\n- Triglycerides\n\n4. Body Composition Metrics\n- Body Mass Index (BMI)\n- Waist circumference\n- Body fat percentage\n\nLet's use the data analysis tool to help interpret some of these metrics.

No pressure to actually walk yet - just consider when it might be possible.\n\n2. In the next day or two, I suggest:\n- Check your calendar for potential 15-20 minute windows for light activity\n- Locate comfortable walking shoes (if you have them)\n- Consider what kind of light movement you might enjoy (walking, casual bike ride, etc.)\n\n3. Optional preparation:\n- If you want, schedule a quick check-in with your doctor\n- But seriously, no pressure if you don't want to\n\nThe key is to make this feel like the absolute minimum effort possible. No guilt, no stress, just a super casual approach to maybe moving a bit more.\n\n*looks at you expectantly*\n\nSo, what sounds doable to you? Want to pick out a potential 10-minute walk time, or should we just let that simmer in the back of your mind for now?"

Blood Pressure Readings\n- Systolic pressure\n- Diastolic pressure\n\n2. Heart Rate\n- Resting heart rate\n- Target heart rate zones\n\n3. Cholesterol Levels\n- Total cholesterol\n- LDL (bad) cholesterol\n- HDL (good) cholesterol\n- Triglycerides\n\n4. Body Composition Metrics\n- Body Mass Index (BMI)\n- Waist circumference\n- Body fat percentage\n\nLet's use the data analysis tool to help interpret some of these metrics. I'll demonstrate with a hypothetical set of blood pressure readings to show how we can track trends:"
