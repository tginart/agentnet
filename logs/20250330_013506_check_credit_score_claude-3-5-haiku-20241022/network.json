Experian: Credit Freeze Completed \u2713\n3. TransUnion: Credit Freeze Completed \u2713\n\nImportant notes:\n- A credit freeze prevents new credit accounts from being opened in your name\n- You'll need to temporarily lift the freeze if you want to apply for new credit\n- Each bureau provides a unique PIN/password to manage your freeze\n- This is one of the strongest protections against identity theft\n\nRecommendations:\n- Keep the freeze management PINs in a secure location\n- If you need to apply for credit, you'll need to temporarily lift the freeze\n- Consider additional credit monitoring services for extra protection\n\nIs there anything else you would like me to help you with regarding your credit protection?"
