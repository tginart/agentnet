While these don't include the actual score, they contain the information used to calculate it.\n\n2. Freezing/Locking Credit: To freeze or lock your credit, you'll need to contact each of the three major credit bureaus individually. This typically involves:\n\n   a) Visiting each bureau's website or calling their dedicated credit freeze line.\n   b) Providing personal information to verify your identity.\n   c) Setting up a PIN or password for unfreezing your credit in the future.\n\nSince we don't have direct access to these services through our available tools, you'll need to do this manually.

While these don't include the actual score, they contain the information used to calculate it.\n\n2. Freezing/Locking Credit: To freeze or lock your credit, you'll need to contact each of the three major credit bureaus individually. This typically involves:\n\n   a) Visiting each bureau's website or calling their dedicated credit freeze line.\n   b) Providing personal information to verify your identity.\n   c) Setting up a PIN or password for unfreezing your credit in the future.\n\nSince we don't have direct access to these services through our available tools, you'll need to do this manually.
